Sure! How about building a Simple Weather Application?

This project will incorporate the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as introducing you to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which are crucial in modern web development. You will use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

Here's the outline of the project:

**Project Name:** Simple Weather Application

**Project Description:** A web application that allows users to search for the current weather in any city around the world. Users should be able to enter the city name and see the current temperature, humidity, and a description of the weather condition.

**Requirements:**

1. **HTML:** This is for the structure of your webpage. You'll need an input field for the user to enter a city name, and areas to display the weather data.

2. **CSS:** This is to make your webpage look good. Style your input field and data display areas.

3. **JavaScript:** This is where most of your programming will be. You'll use JavaScript to capture the city name that the user inputs, send that data to the OpenWeatherMap API, receive the weather data, and update your HTML with this data.

**Steps to Follow:**

1. **Set Up Your HTML and CSS:** 

    - Create an HTML form that takes a city name as input.
    - Add elements that will display the weather data.
    - Use CSS to style your webpage.

2. **JavaScript: Fetch Weather Data:**

    - Add an event listener to your form that will trigger when the form is submitted.
    - When the form is submitted, prevent the default form submission and instead fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

3. **JavaScript: Display the Weather Data:**

    - Once you have the weather data, display it in the elements you created in your HTML.

Remember, the key here is practice. The more you use these skills, the better you'll become. Also, don't be afraid to look up things you don't know. Even experienced programmers often need to refer to documentation or tutorials.
